Build : 2
Version : 2.5.0


Description:

- Complete codebase refactor
- Improvements and bug fixes

## Program Structure

### Landing Stage

* The Landing stage microcontroller is the main controller with the boost controller being a sub controller. It uses Bluetooth(HC-05, HC-06 ) to communicate with boost stage microcontroller to control Boost Stage Thrust Vectoring. The boost stage controller only independently handles its parachute deployment.

#### Data Logging Module
* EEPROM storage
* SD storage

#### Flight Control Module
* Axis Stability System
* Thrust Vector Control

#### Inertial Measurement
* Axis Values(X,Y,Z)
* Calculate pitch,yaw and roll from IMU

#### Flight Navigation Module
* Active Path Planning
* Path Deviation Control

#### RF Communication Module
* [EXPERIMENTAL COMMUNICATION WITH GROUND STATION]

#### Sensor Module
* Interface GPS,altimeter,airspeed

### Boost Stage 

#### Communication Module
* Recieve commands from landing Stgae
* Log Data (Errors)
* Send ejection trigger

#### Trigger Module
* Compute decceleration to send ejection trigger
* Detect altitude for chute deployment

#### Sensor Module
* Interface altimeter
