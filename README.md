NEO-Hover Flight Computer

Description:

NEO-Rocket Flight Computer is an experimentally based ATmega2560 microcontroller based model rocket.

The aim for this project is to create a a fully independent flight system fitted with autonomous GPS point to point navigation,
deviation monitoring and control, data logging,and vertical takeoff and landing support.This program is developed in conjunction with the
PlatformIO IDE system with integration into VSCode.

Features:

Support for vertical landing,
Active Flight Data Logging,
GPS based navigation.
